# IceGiant: Database DeFi Protocol

IceGiant is committed to building DeFi protocol for Web3 database, and introduces database storage and retrieval capabilities into Web3 by using database, smart contract, NFT and DeFi technologies. The database platform is not controlled by the centralized company, and users can control their own data permissions and access process. At present, IceGiant mainly supports NoSQL and SQL application access protocols, and will support graphs, time series and other protocols in the future to help Web3 applications quickly access decentralized data DAO.

In addition, IceGiant also integrates the concepts of NFT and DeFi into the database field, providing more possibilities for the development of Web3 ecology. NFT can be used to represent different data assets in the database, while DeFi can provide more efficient and secure financial management and transaction services for data DAO. This integration combines database and digital asset management, which can provide a more complete solution for data management and data asset transaction in Web3 ecosystem.

In this new database ecology, users can not only control their own data, but also transform data into digital assets, which can be managed and traded through NFT. At the same time, DeFi can provide more perfect financial management and transaction services for data DAO, making data DAO more efficient and sustainable in the Web3 ecosystem.

# Motivation

For the web3 field, there is currently no way to write a complete client application as easily as in web2, and make it completely decentralized. In web2, you start a database on AWS and let your client application call the database for reading and writing. But there is nothing like it in web3. You can't just write data to Ethereum, which is too expensive for most users. Storage protocols such as Filecoin and Arweave are mainly used to archive data, but they do not provide enterprise-level performance guarantee for writing and reading data.

Another flaw of the Web2 database is that users cannot convert their own data into digital assets for transaction and management. This means that users cannot obtain economic value from their own data, nor can they obtain benefits through data transactions. This limits the utilization and value realization of users' own data.

Here, we introduce IceGiant, which is a scalable web3 DeFi database, which uses RESP and SQL protocols to support dApps fast access and use of decentralized databases.IceGiant integrates NFT and DeFi technologies, and users' database data can be converted into digital assets, providing more possibilities for data management and transactions. This fusion can combine database and digital asset management to provide a more complete solution for data management and data asset transactions. Through the empowerment of data application access protocol, NFT and DeFi technology, IceGiant can provide users with more efficient, secure and sustainable data management and transaction services, and provide more possibilities for the realization and utilization of data value.

Using the advantages of IceGiant can be divided into four different categories:
1. Accelerate the dApp development process: By using RESP and SQL protocols, developers can quickly build and deploy decentralized applications, helping web2/web3 applications quickly access data decentralization capabilities.

2. Forge the value of database assets in applications: IceGiant converts data in user databases into digital assets by combining NFT and DeFi technologies, providing more possibilities for data management and transactions. Enhance user data transaction capabilities and provide a more sustainable economic infrastructure for data transactions and utilization.

3. Fast and secure database storage and retrieval: Since IceGiant uses technologies such as data fragmentation, data retrieval gateway, and FlowShield decentralized security network, it can provide fast data storage and query speed. At the same time, through the support of NFT and DeFi technology, IceGiant can inspire global database manufacturers to provide more data access points, thereby enhancing users' data storage and retrieval performance.

4. Enhance dApp data combination and complex data usage scenarios: Through NFT and DeFi technology, IceGiant converts data into digital assets for transaction and management, providing more possibilities for data. This can provide more efficient, secure and sustainable solutions for data markets, governance, storage and analysis, etc., while promoting the development of the Web3 ecosystem. The integration of these technologies can allow users to better grasp and trade their own data, realize the maximum value of data, and promote the expansion of data application scenarios and value.

IceGiant also supports the development of some features that were previously not possible in web3. By providing developers with full-featured NoSQL and SQL engines, IceGiant allows developers to perform complex queries on massive data sets in milliseconds. This level of optimization can further push web3 applications into a data-driven state without sacrificing the decentralized nature of their products.

The key to mass adoption of web3 technology is that it can provide end users with the user experience they have grown accustomed to in web2. The loading time of a web page directly affects the conversion rate of your business. Walmart found that for every second of reduction in page load time, conversion rates increased by 2%. The gateway loading time of web3 distributed storage needs to be optimized. The core goal of IceGiant is to provide users with a fast and rich data structure DeFi database system.

Master the data, master the future! IceGiant is a DeFi technology-based database that makes data management and transactions more efficient, secure and sustainable. We convert data into digital assets for transaction and management, so that data has unlimited possibilities! Whether you are a digital asset trader, a data analyst or a data DAO manager, we will provide you with the most complete, efficient and secure data solutions, allowing you to grasp the power of data and control future opportunities! Let IceGiant become your power to grasp the value of data!
