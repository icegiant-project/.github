# Data DAO
IceGiant is on the road of building Data Dao, we are beneficial to the contract to bring all the data platform capabilities into web3, there is no central company control, allowing users to control data rights and read and write by themselves. We currently mainly support NoSQL protocols, and will support SQL and time series database protocols in the future to help web3 build a decentralized data DAO.

# Motivation

For the web3 field, there is currently no way to write a complete client application as easily as in web2, and make it completely decentralized. In web2, you start a database on AWS and let your client application call the database for reading and writing. But there is nothing like it in web3. You can't just write data to Ethereum, which is too expensive for most users. Storage protocols such as Filecoin and Arweave are mainly used to archive data, but they do not provide enterprise-level performance guarantee for writing and reading data.

In this article, we introduce IceGiant, which is a novel solution that can realize highly scalable and decentralized NoSQL database. Using RESP as the main interactive protocol, IceGiant supports rapid, complex and decentralized development, while eliminating the need for developers to learn any new skills and languages.

Using the advantages of IceGiant can be divided into four different categories:
1. Greatly shorten the development time.
2. Enhance the functions and customization of web3/web2 applications
3. Fast data query speed and loading time
4. Enhance the simplicity of data combination and complex data usage scenarios.

Firstly, the implementation of distributed NoSQL database enables almost every developer to build on the decentralized architecture. RESP, as a popular communication protocol of Redis database in the world, has now become the main communication protocol of NoSQL database. Redis, as the NoSQL database with the first market share in web2 environment, is widely used by developers all over the world. By being compatible with RESP communication protocol, IceGiant greatly reduces the development time and technical threshold, thus promoting the development of decentralized applications.

IceGiant also supports the development of some functions that were previously impossible in web3. By providing developers with a full-featured NoSQL engine, IceGiant allows developers to perform complex queries on massive data sets within milliseconds. This level of optimization can further push web3 applications into a data-driven state without sacrificing the decentralized nature of its products.

The key to the large-scale adoption of web3 technology is that it can provide the end users with the user experience they have become accustomed to in web2. The loading time of web pages directly affects the conversion rate of business. Wal-Mart found that the conversion rate will increase by 2% every time the page loading time is reduced by one second. The gateway loading time of web3 distributed storage still needs to be optimized. The core goal of IceGiant is to provide users with a fast and rich data structure NoSQL data set system.

Finally, IceGiant provides richer data expression and data combination functions. For the current dilemma that web3 can only read and write in KV, we provide strings\hashes\lists\sorted sets\sets data structure to achieve unprecedented interoperability at application data level. IceGiant supports the conventional RESP communication protocol. Whether developers want to use application data sets or are interested in specific data segments, IceGiant provides a simple and efficient way to use data.
